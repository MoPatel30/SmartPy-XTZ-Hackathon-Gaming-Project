# SmartPy-XTZ-Hackathon-Gaming-Project

Group project submitted for the 2020 Tezos Hackathon under the Gaming section.
Timeframe: May 25th - June 25th


# Game Title: Betting Against the Odds

Two users verse each other to guess seven randomly generated numbers between 0-100. The closest guess for each of the seven numbers
wins that round, and the user with the most won rounds wins the game. If users end up with the same amount of wins, a tiebreaker round occurs. Users must include their XTZ public address and amount being wagered in order to participate. 

The winner gets the pot!

Good Luck and choose wisely!


# About the project

This project was created using the SmartPy IDE and SmartPy library, which allows for the creation of smart contracts and enables 
them to be integrated with the tezos blockchain. 

SmartPy is a python library that uses the latest python syntax, with the addition of new features to be able to write the smart contracts.


# Team

This is our first time working with SmartPy and creating smart contracts, and integrating it with a two-player game. 
We are all early Computer Science students who have a knack for coding and are interested in all things blockchain, so this 
is us contributing as best as we can to the small blockchain world. 

We hope you enjoy, and feel free to reach out to us for any questions, comments, or concerns.

Thanks!
