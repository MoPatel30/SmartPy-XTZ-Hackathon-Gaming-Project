# SmartPy-XTZ-Hackathon-Gaming-Project

Group project submitted for the 2020 Tezos Hackathon under the Gaming section.

# Game Title: Betting Against the Odds

Two users verse each other to guess seven randomly generated numbers between 0-100. The closest guess for each of the seven numbers
wins that round for that specific number, and the user with the most won rounds (closest to majority of the seven numbers) wins the game. If users end up with the same amount of wins, a tiebreaker round occurs.  

The winner gets the choice to engrave their victory on the blockchain forever!

Good Luck and choose wisely!


# About the project

This project was created using the SmartPy IDE and SmartPy library, which allows for the creation of smart contracts and enables 
them to be integrated with the tezos blockchain. 

SmartPy is a python library that uses the latest python syntax, with the addition of new features to be able to write the smart contracts.

Smart contracts were integrated into our game, Betting Against the Odds, to enable players to test their guessing skills. the code of the smart contract allows the winner to deploy their victory onto the blockchain, with both the players submitted names. 



# How to play 

Simply just copy the all the code in the single python file attached and paste it into the online SmartPy IDE (https://smartpy.io/dev/).

Then click the green 'Run' button and follow the prompted alerts on the screen and fill in all fields wisely. 

Instructions to deploy to the blockchain are also provided.


# Team

This is our first time working with SmartPy and creating smart contracts, and integrating it with a two-player game. 
We are all early Computer Science students who have a knack for coding and are interested in all things blockchain, so this 
is us contributing as best as we can to the growing blockchain world. 

This isn't a high-level, time consuming game by any means as the idea behind it is quite simple. Regardless, we really hope you enjoy, and feel free to reach out to us for any questions, comments, or concerns.

Good luck making (possibly) money!

Thanks!
